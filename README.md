# DNAS Reports

This repo contains the daily reports generated by the [DFZ Name and Shame](https://github.com/jwbensley/dfz_name_and_shame/) ("DNAS") parser.

## Overview

The daily reports generated by DNAS, which are published in this repo, contain only the worst data found within the DFZ. The reports are the *[Top Trumps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Trumps)* of garbage being advertised into the global BGP DFZ. It is *not* all the unwanted/bad information advertised into the DFZ. There is a large amount of unwanted data in the DFZ, reporting all of it wouldnâ€™t be very interesting or entertaining.

To produce a report of only the "worst" data in the DFZ, the statistics from the parsed MRT files are aggregated based on a property of the BGP UPDATE message. The aggregating property depends on the kind of statistic being reported. For example, not every bogon prefix found in the DFZ is listed in the daily report, only the bogon prefixes with the highest number of unique origin ASNs are listed. In this example, detecting a higher number of unique origin ASNs for a bogon prefix can be used as a proxy metric, to infer that the prefix was more "visible" across the DFZ than another bogon prefix with fewer origin ASNs.

The report currently exist in a plain-text human readable format only. Additional formats such as a JSON parseable format are coming soon.
